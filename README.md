# BOTanicals 
BOTanicals is a company that makes robotic flowers, the environmental and hypoallergenic alternative to traditional flowers. These flowers change color to suit your mood, glow in the dark, and never die. They're controlled by a state-of-the-art Salesforce org that's connected to the Internet of Things. You're just in time for the BOTanical Bonus Bouquet promotion. In this project, we automate a business process to support the promotion. Specifically, we code our app to add a bonus bouquet every time an order is activated.
